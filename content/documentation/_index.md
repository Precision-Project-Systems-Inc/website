DummyChain (Dchain) is built to be flexible and to have minimal presence in your workspace. It is a on-premise solution and does not need a server to be running 24/7. It utilizes your existing computing resources to record and keep track of changes in a central, distributed ledger, also known as states. The user client automatically performs the writing and reading of states. Unlike common blockchain implementations, there is no explicit consensus mechanism. This is because you can verify the correct state by checking the logs of the applications in your workspace. Dchain is meant to be a simple solution to represent your workspace.
