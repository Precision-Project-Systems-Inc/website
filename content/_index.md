# The power of **crypto** at your fingertips

DummyChain is a blockchain implementation that wraps around your workspace. Its purpose is to **uproot** -- as opposed to embed -- crypto onto your day-to-day operations. 

## Features:
- Local
- Secure-less; requires no consensus mechanism
- Lightweight; the entire chain's data could be stored on a few files
- Open-source
